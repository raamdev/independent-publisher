Independent Publisher WordPress Theme
=====================

## Using a Child Theme to Customize Independent Publisher

If there are things you want to tweak in the Independent Publisher theme, a [Child Theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) is the recommended method for doing so. By using a Child Theme, you can make changes without worrying about those changes being overwritten by a future update to the parent theme.

After you've installed the Independent Publisher theme, download the [Independent Publisher Child Theme](https://github.com/raamdev/independent-publisher-child-theme/) and install and activate it. You can then start making changes to the Child Theme's files to override the parent theme. The Independent Publisher Child Theme comes with a few examples to help you get started.

For more information on using Child Themes, see the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes).
